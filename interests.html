            <h2>My (Current) Interests</h2>

            <div class="interest-container">
                <h3>Beyond Standard Model Physics</h3>
                <p>The Standard Model is an excellent Effective Field Theory, it is able to match, to an obscene level of precision, any high energy physics experiment we are currently
                able to make. Nevertheless, it is undeniably incomplete, there are simply too many things it is not able to predict. To name a few: there are no mechanisms
                to give mass to neutrinos in the Standard Model; No UV complete theory of Quantum Gravity; No explanation to fine tuning/hierarchy problems; and many more.
                </p>
                <p> Evidently then, there's much work to be done, both theoretical and experimental. How do we build models to address a few of these shortcomings? Given
                models that do, where will their deviations from Standard Model predictions manifest most strongly given what we can do experimentally? How do we build better
                experiments or better utilize the ones we already have? These are all equally important questions, and we need as a community, people to work on all of them,
                and most of all, work together. I am currently more interested in the theoretical side of things, working on trying to answer the first two questions, particularly
                given that the next generation of colliders will be precision machines. 
                </p>

            <div class="interest-container">
                <h3>Quantum Field Theory</h3>
                <p>Quantum Field Theory is (arguably, but not really arguable) the most powerful framework we currently have in physics. It's incredibly versatile and yet 
                capable of immense precision. And yet, there is a lot we don't understand about it, particularly, we are very ignorant about what happens in non-perturbative regimes
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="interest-container">
                <h3>Scattering Amplitudes</h3>
                <p>Although extremely predictive, Quantum Field Theory forces us to pay a price for building local and manifest Lorentz Invariant Lagrangians. 
                Particularly, if our theory includes massless particles, we need Gauge Invariance so the degrees of freedom match. This, especially for non-Abelian Gauge
                Theories, makes building amplitudes extremely cumbersome, we need to not only consider the complicated Gauge Boson - Gauge Boson interactions, but as 
                Faddeev and Popov taught us, we need unphysical ghost as well. For a 4 gluon amplitude in Yang Mills, if we are to compute the cross-section in the
                context of QFT, we would need to deal with well over 1000 terms, and yet, upon simplification, the result is incredibly simple. A natural question is then,
                surely there's a better way of doing this? The program of On-Shell Amplitudes is precisely dedicated to ideas like this. By imposing only the most fundamental
                restrictions to the form of the amplitude, how much of its form can one deduce without having to jump through the hoops of QFT. And can we learn new lessons
                about nature by doing so?</p>
